This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that lacks proper error handling for database operations and invalid user IDs. This can lead to application crashes or the return of incomplete or misleading responses to the client. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.
